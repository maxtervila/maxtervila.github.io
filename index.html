        <p>You can get to <strong class="buzios">Buzios</strong> from Rio with bus. It's quite cheap and the buses are nice and comfortable. The journey takes around 3 hours. Be sure to be in time in the bus station because it's fucking chaotic. Also, as always in marvellous Rio keep in mind the thiefs. When you come back make sure to get a safe taxi to get back to your home in Rio. Here is some things to remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring copy of your passport </li>
            <li>Bring books or download podcasts to be enterntained during the bus trip </li>
            <li>Bring swimming glases because the water is incredibly clear </li>
        </ul>
